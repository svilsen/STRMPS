Description: Loading, identifying, aggregating, manipulating, and analysing short tandem repeat regions of massively parallel sequencing data in forensic genetics. 'STRMPS' can work with the package 'STRaitRazoR' (an R interface to the 'STRaitRazor' commandline tool) for added speed. 'STRaitRazoR' only works on linux and can found at <https://github.com/svilsen/STRaitRazoR>. The analyses and framework implemented in this package relies on the papers of Vilsen et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.01.017> and Vilsen et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.04.003>. Lastly, note that the parallelisation in the package relies on 'mclapply()' and, thus, speed-ups will only be seen on UNIX based systems.
