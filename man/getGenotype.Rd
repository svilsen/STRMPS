\title{Assigns genotype.}
\usage{
getGenotype(stringCoverageListObject, colBelief = "Coverage",
  thresholdSignal = 0, thresholdHeterozygosity = 0.35,
  thresholdAbsoluteLowerLimit = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{stringCoverageListObject}{an stringCoverageList-object, created using the \link{stringCoverage}-function.}

\item{colBelief}{the name of the coloumn used for identification.}

\item{thresholdSignal}{threshold applied to the signal (generally the coverage) of every string.}

\item{thresholdHeterozygosity}{threshold used to determine whether a marker is hetero- or homozygous.}
}
\value{
Returns a list, with an element for every marker in stringCoverageList-object, each element contains the genotype for a given marker.
}
\description{
\code{getGenotype} takes an stringCoverageList-object, assumes the sample is a reference file and assings a genotype, based on a heterozygote threshold, for every marker in the provided list.
